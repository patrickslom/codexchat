- [ ] heartbeat disabled by default.
- [ ] heartbeat cap default 10, optional unlimited.
- [ ] upload max default 15 MB.
- [ ] Include shared-workspace non-privacy warning flag/content.

- [ ] Verify uploads/downloads and path injection into Codex turns.
- [ ] Verify heartbeat worker runs independently from API responsiveness.
- [ ] Verify `/api` + `/ws` routing compatibility with Traefik single-domain setup.

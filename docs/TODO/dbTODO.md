## 6) Archive/Soft Delete Behavior
- [ ] Standardize `archived_at` nullable timestamp semantics across archivable tables.
- [ ] Ensure default queries exclude archived rows.
- [ ] Add admin/archive queries that can include archived rows.
- [ ] Add recover/restore migration-safe workflow notes.

## 7) Indexing and Performance
- [ ] Add index on `conversations.updated_at` for sidebar ordering.
- [ ] Add index on `messages.conversation_id, created_at` for timeline fetch.
- [ ] Add index on `files.conversation_id, created_at` for attachment retrieval.
- [ ] Add index on `sessions.expires_at` for cleanup jobs.
- [ ] Add index on `conversation_locks.expires_at` for stale lock scanning.
- [ ] Add text search indexes for MVP+ conversation search (title/content).

## 8) Constraints and Data Integrity
- [ ] Add foreign keys for conversation/message/file relations.
- [ ] Add cascade/archive behavior policy (avoid hard cascade delete in MVP).
- [ ] Add check constraints for role enums (`user`, `admin`) and message roles.
- [ ] Add uniqueness constraints where required (`users.email`, conversation lock uniqueness).
- [ ] Add size/value constraints for configured limits where appropriate.

## 9) Seed and Bootstrap Data
- [ ] Add migration/seed path for first admin user creation support.
- [ ] Add default settings seed row with product defaults.
- [ ] Ensure idempotent seed behavior.

## 10) Operational Jobs and Maintenance
- [ ] Add periodic cleanup strategy for expired sessions.
- [ ] Add periodic cleanup strategy for stale locks.
- [ ] Add archival maintenance notes for old messages/files.
- [ ] Add DB backup/restore runbook notes for production.

## 11) Alembic Migration Hygiene
- [ ] Split migrations into logical phases (core/auth/settings/heartbeat/locks/indexes).
- [ ] Ensure every migration has tested downgrade path where safe.
- [ ] Add migration naming conventions and review checklist.
- [ ] Add startup guard to fail fast if DB revision is behind.

## 12) Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Verify fresh migration apply on empty DB.
- [ ] Verify migration upgrade path from prior revisions.
- [ ] Verify archived records are hidden by default queries.
- [ ] Verify restore-from-archive flow works for conversation/message/file records.
- [ ] Verify lock table behavior under concurrent send attempts.
- [ ] Verify heartbeat tables populate correctly during runs.
- [ ] Verify search-related indexes exist and are used for target queries.
